        How it began In the summer of 2013, I opened my mission call for The
        Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saint in the house that I grew up
        in, in Utah. I was called to serve in The Philippines, Tagalog speaking.
        This came as a huge surprise to me and my family. We had assumed that I
        was going stateside due to dietary restrictions. On top of that, the
        only thing that I really knew about the Philippines was that it is an
        archipelago in Asia. I had no idea how much of a positive effect the
        people and culture of The Philippines would have on my life. January 1,
        2014 I boarded a flight to the Philippines to attend the Missionary
        Training Center. The days were long and grueling and by the end of my
        time in the MTC I had made some great friends. Upon leaving, I felt like
        I was at the bottom of my class when it came to speaking Tagalog.
        Luckily, I had a phenomenal trainer who was patient with my language
        learning. He taught me the importance of diligently studying the
        language every single day. I went about six months not feeling
        comfortable speaking Tagalog. Then I got called to train a new
        missionary. It was sink or swim because now I had to lead contacting and
        lessons. I was again fortunate to be blessed with another supportive and
        patient companion as I learned the language. Jaryl Miguel, who is native
        to the Philippines. We discovered the Baybayin (also known as Alibata)
        script in a Tagalog dictionary and started to learn it. Soon enough we
        were able to effortlessly write notes back and forth in this ancient
        script. (Elder (Jaryl) Miguel and I in the Philippines Quezon City North
        Mission circa 2014) By the end of my mission, I was speaking Tagalog
        just as well as the friends I made in the MTC. Even Filipinos would
        mistake me for a kababayan (countrymen) if they heard me speak without
        seeing my face. I feel like I was diligent in my study therefore I “won
        the prize” (Mosiah 4:27). That prize was the gift of tongues. Soon after
        returning home, I started working in the church in a call center for The
        Philippines. This position gave me the opportunity to keep my language
        skills while also continuing to contribute to the church growth in The
        Philippines and work with some wonderful Filipinos. In 2018 I enrolled
        at BYU-Hawaii. This was a great opportunity for me to continue my
        education. It also allowed me to continue speaking Tagalog due to all of
        the Filipinos attending school there. To my surprise, my former mission
        companion, Elder Miguel, lived in the dorm just a few doors down. There
        I met another great friend of mine, EJ Pelera. He was from Baguio, which
        is a city just a few hours north of my mission. It was amazing to
        interact with and form deeper connections with both EJ and Jaryl at
        BYUH. (EJ Pelera and I at BYU-Hawaii circa 2019) During my last semester
        I took a class where we used Excel to deconstruct and analyze Jacob
        chapter 5. The principles that I learned in this class would build the
        foundational skills required to begin my project of transcribing "Ang
        Aklat Ni Mormon" (The Book of Mormon) into the book you hold now. After
        completing a Bachelor's degree from BYUH in late 2019, I returned home.
        During 2020 April General Conference the thought came to me that I may
        be able to transcribe “Ang Aklat Ni Mormon” from its modern script into
        Baybayin.This is where my journey of transcription began. While
        listening to one session of conference I worked on developing a proof of
        concept. Before the end of that session I had completed a full
        transcription of First Nephi chapter 1 into Baybain. Over the course of
        the following months, I was able to transcribe, review, edit and format
        most of the “Ang Aklat ni Mormon”, but I was still missing a second and
        third look over. That is when I enlisted the help of my friends Jaryl
        and EJ. I sent them over a list of the unique words (about 15,700 words)
        to review and a couple of months later they came back to me with
        meaningful feedback and changes. It took me nearly two years to fully
        implement their changes due to significant life changes that happened. I
        moved to a new country, married the love of my life, took on two
        wonderful stepdaughters, started a pregnancy and was given more
        responsibility at work. But, “sa awa ng Diyos” (through the grace of
        God) I was able to finish the updating and editing by the end April
        2023. Overall, I have had a great time working on this project and
        collaborating with two great friends of mine. I have learned so much
        from the Filipino community both within the Philippines and worldwide. I
        am excited and hopeful that this transcription of the “Ang Aklat ni
        Mormon” will be a positive contribution to the Filipino literature and
        culture. Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat! -Chaz
