      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Chaz. I am a software engineer and a husband and father.
        I am also the founder of The Baybayin Project. I was born and raised in
        Utah. I currently live in Utah with my wife and three children.
      </p>
      <h2>How it began</h2>
      <p>
        In the summer of 2013, I opened my mission call for The Church of Jesus
        Christ of Latter-day Saint. I was called to serve in The Philippines for
        two years and was to learn Tagalog. This came as a huge surprise to me
        and my family. At the time the only thing that I really knew about the
        Philippines was that it is an archipelago in Asia. I had no idea how
        much of a positive effect the people and culture of The Philippines
        would have on my life. On January 1, 2014 I boarded a flight to the
        Philippines to attend the Missionary Training Center. There I would
        study and learn Tagalog. The days were long and grueling. Upon leaving,
        I felt like I was at the bottom of my class when it came to speaking
        Tagalog. Luckily, I had a phenomenal trainer in the field who was
        patient with my language learning. He taught me the importance of
        diligently studying the language every single day. Over the course of my
        mission that daily habit compounded and turned me into a fluent speaker
        of Tagalog. At some point I discovered the Baybayin (also known as
        Alibata) script in a Tagalog dictionary and started to learn it. Soon
        enough I was able to effortlessly write notes back and forth with
        friends of mine who also learned the baybayin script.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon after returning home, I started working for The Church of Jesus
        Christ of Latter-day Saints in a call center for The Philippines. This
        position gave me the opportunity to keep my language skills while also
        continuing to work with some amazing Filipinos.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2018 I enrolled at BYU-Hawaii. This was not only a great opportunity
        for me to continue my education, but it also allowed me to continue
        speaking Tagalog due to all of the Filipinos that attended school there.
        During my last semester I took a class where we used Excel to
        deconstruct and analyze a chapter of a book. The principles that I
        learned in this class would build the foundational skills required to
        begin my first project, transcribing "Ang Aklat Ni Mormon" (The Book of
        Mormon).
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing a Bachelor's degree from BYUH in 2019, I returned home.
        In April of 2020, the thought came to me that I may be able to
        transcribe “Ang Aklat Ni Mormon” into Baybayin. I soon had a proof of
        concept for the first chapter of ANM. Over the course of the following
        months, I was able to transcribe, review, edit and format most of the
        “Ang Aklat ni Mormon”. I sent two of my friends over a list of the
        unique words (about 15,700 words) to review and a couple of months later
        they came back to me with meaningful feedback and changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took me nearly two years to fully implement their changes due to
        significant life changes that happened. I moved to a new country,
        married the love of my life, took on two wonderful stepdaughters,
        started a pregnancy and was given more responsibility at work. But, “sa
        awa ng Diyos” (through the grace of God) I was able to finish the
        updating and editing the first draft by April 2023.

        We currently have several projects in the works. For a full list of
        projects, please visit the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I have had a great time working on these projects. I have
        learned so much from the Filipino community both within the Philippines
        and worldwide. Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat! -Chaz
